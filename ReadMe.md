## Comprehensive Documentation for IP Subnet Calculator

### Introduction
The IP Subnet Calculator is a Python script designed to perform various calculations and analyses related to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets. It provides functionalities to convert IP addresses between different representations (decimal, hexadecimal, binary), calculate subnet details, determine IP address types, validate IP addresses, classify IPv4 addresses into classes, and more. Additionally, it offers the flexibility to output results in either terminal display, CSV files, or JSON format.

### Features
1. **IP Address Conversion:**
    - Convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to decimal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.
2. **Subnet Calculation:**
    - Calculate network address, broadcast address, total number of hosts, number of usable hosts, CIDR notation, usable host IP range, subnet, subnet mask, and host mask for a given IP address and CIDR notation.
3. **IP Address Type Identification:**
    - Determine the type of an IP address (e.g., private, public, loopback, link-local, multicast).
4. **Input Validation:**
    - Validate IP addresses and CIDR notations for correctness.
5. **IP Address Class Identification:**
    - Classify IPv4 addresses into classes (A, B, C, Loopback, Reserved, Unknown).
6. **Output Flexibility:**
    - Choose output format: terminal display, CSV files, or JSON format.
7. **User-Friendly Interface:**
    - Interactive command-line interface for easy interaction and usage.
8. **Error Handling:**
    - Robust error handling for various scenarios like invalid inputs, file not found, permission denied, etc.

### Installation
To begin using the IP Subnet Calculator, follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Obtain the source code by cloning the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kavineksith/IP-Address-and-Subnet-Calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the cloned project directory:
   ```
   cd IP-Address-and-Subnet-Calculator
   ```

3. **Run the IP Subnet Calculator**: Execute the appropriate script (`ip_address_manager_v4.py` for IPv4 or `ip_address_manager_v6.py` for IPv6) to start using the IP Subnet Calculator:
   ```
   python ip_address_manager_v4.py
   ```

   ```
   python ip_address_manager_v6.py
   ```

By following these steps, you'll have the IP Subnet Calculator up and running in no time, ready to assist with your network management tasks.

### Usage
To use the IP Subnet Calculator, follow these steps:
1. **Run the Script:**
    - Execute the script (`ip_address_manager_v4.py` or `ip_address_manager_v6.py`).
2. **Input IP Address:**
    - Enter an IP address followed by CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1/24` for IPv4 or `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334/64` for IPv6).
    - To exit the program, type `exit`.
    - To process multiple IP addresses from a file, type `multiple` and provide the file location.
3. **Select Output Format:**
    - Choose an output format:
        - `1`: Terminal Display
        - `2`: CSV File
        - `3`: JSON Format
4. **View Results:**
    - Results will be displayed according to the selected output format.
